          <p>Nan’s love of fashion started at an early age. Hand sewing and embroidering clothes for her dolls evolved into designing clothes that she sold in boutiques in Carmel, CA in high school while studying haute couture tailoring and construction with an expert. She then attended UC Davis, graduating with a degree in Fashion Design. During her senior year, she won a trip to New York City with Mademoiselle Magazine and realized a dream to visit Parson’s School of Design; where she returned the following year to study fashion. Nan entered the fashion industry in New York City but another dream called her away.  A month-long study trip to Paris resulted in over three years working for several Haute Couture firms. Returning to New York City, her professional experience spanned 25 years designing casual and career sportswear at Liz Claiborne, Federated Department Stores, and Talbot’s.</p>
          <p><i>Fashion Dream Tours</i> grew out of Nan’s experience and love of Paris. She has been leading month-long Study Abroad trips for fashion students from the University of California and now is expanding to guided vacation tours for adults.</p>
          <p>Nan will be the tour quide for the initial tours.</p>
          <p>Nan is the CEO of Fashion Dream Tours.</p>
